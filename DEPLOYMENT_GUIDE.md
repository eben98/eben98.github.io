# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Why Your Website Changes Aren't Showing Up

The website changes you've made are **working perfectly** but they're not visible on your live website because:

1. **Branch Issue**: Your changes are currently on the feature branch `copilot/fix-24e6d7c4-655d-4117-adaa-55459aeecb6d`
2. **GitHub Pages Configuration**: GitHub Pages for user sites (like `eben98.github.io`) serves content from the `main` branch by default
3. **Missing Merge**: The changes need to be merged from this PR branch to the `main` branch to go live

## Website Preview

Your website is working beautifully! Here's what it looks like:

**Hero Section:**
